# Keep XP

Mod is available on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/keep-xp-on-death-with-perm).

This Minecraft Fabric mod allows you to keep your hard-earned experience points (XP) even after death. No more worrying about losing levels and hours spent farming!

## Key Features

- **Keep XP on Death:** Never lose your XP after death again.
- **Client-Server Compatibility:** The mod works on both client and server sides (So it works on singleplayer or as a server mod - not required on client!).
- **Two Modes of Operation:**
    - **Default Mode:** XP is preserved for all players on the server.
    - **Permissions Mode:** XP is only preserved for players with the `keep.xp` permission.
- **Automatic Permission Detection:** The mod automatically detects and uses the Permissions API (e.g., LuckPerms).
- **Manual Override:** If needed, you can manually enable XP preservation for all players using the `/keepxp override on` command.

## Commands

- `/keepxp help`: Displays a brief overview of available commands.
- `/keepxp override [on|off]`: Enables or disables XP preservation for all players.
- `/keepxp status`: Displays the current mode in which the mod is operating.

## Usage

- **Default Mode:** After installing the mod, XP is automatically preserved for all players on the server.
- **Permissions Mode:** If you want the mod to work with permissions, assign the `keep.xp` permission to players (e.g., using LuckPerms).
- **Manual Override:** If needed, you can use the `/keepxp override on` command to enable XP preservation for all players.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

    - **A:** Yes, the mod works in single player as well.
- **Q: Do I need to have the Permissions API installed?**
    - **A:** No, the mod automatically detects and uses the Permissions API if available. If you don't want to use permissions, you can manually enable XP preservation for all players using the `/keepxp override on` command.
